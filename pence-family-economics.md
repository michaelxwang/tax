## Analysis of family economics of vice president Mike Pence

The tax history project has compiled
an archive of [the presidential tax returns](http://www.taxhistory.org/www/website.nsf/Web/PresidentialTaxReturns),
in which we have the tax returns of Pence family from 2006 to 2015. By
going through these returns, we can see his family financial situation,
and the changes they had gone through these 10 years. All the information
contained in this analysis comes from the tax returns except otherwise
noted.

### 2006

In 2006, Michael R. Pence family filed a joint return with his wife Karen
Pence claiming three children, the oldest Michael J, the middle daughter
Charlotte, and youngest daughter Audrey. all under 17. They live in my
neighborhood Arlington, VA. Mr. Pence was a member of congress (house
of representative), and Mrs. Pence is a teacher.

Their combined wage was \$161K. As revealed in later years, Mr. Pence
earned about \$150K and Mrs. Pence earned \$10K and \$30K depending how
much she worked. Mrs. Pence had self employment taxable income of \$400
(gross \$1,215), which had been like this through out the years. Mr. Pence
had a one time speaking fee of \$1,000.

They owned a house. They paid property tax \$6,172. Assuming the real
estate tax rate was 1%, the value of their house is around \$600K. They
paid the mortgage interest \$32,151. Assuming the mortgage interest is
5%, they has a debt of \$640K. They are a little under water. They had
a cash donation \$11,986 this year, and it is normally between \$10K
and \$20K in good years, and less than \$10K in bad years.

They managed to get \$500 child credit out of the \$3,000 maximum possible.

### 2007

The only thing that is worth noting was that they filed an amended
return for the year 2007 to remove the \$1,194 retirement distribution
from taxable income because it had been rolled over within 60 days. The
amended return generated a \$430 additional refund. This amendment was
not required to file, either the \$430 was important to Pence family,
or it is important to the accountant to get things right. It is revealed
that the accountant charged \$670 for the tax return for the prior year,
which is a simple return. Many of my clients do not know the market
price of the tax return, now they should realize that I represent the
conscience of this profession.

### 2008 - 2011

Life went on went on eventlessly from the perspective of the tax returns,
but challenge is under way as Michael J. turned 17 in 2008, Charlotte
turned 17 in 2010, and Audrey turned 17 in 2011.

### 2012

The year 2012 saw a major change of Pence family. The address on the
return was Indiana, and the occupation of Mr. Pence was changed from
legislator to governor, but this was his address and occupation in 2013,
as Mr. Pence still had W2 from house of representative, and Mrs. Pence
from Immanuel Christian School in Springfield, VA. Their combined wage
was \$164K which was almost the same as in 2006.

I am not sure why both the property tax was \$4,596 (vs \$7,020 in 2011),
the mortgage interest was \$19,844 (vs \$26,546 in 2011) were lower this
year, as they sold the house next year.

Both Michael J. and Charlotte were in college, and both claimed Hope /
American opportunity credit. Michael J. went to Purdue University in
Indiana, and Charlotte went to Depaul University in Illinois. As Michael
J. (21) was two years older than Charlotte (19), I am certain if Michael
J. did not go to college directly, or did not claim the credit in prior
years. The maximum education credit for two students were \$5,000, due
to their "high" income, the credit was reduced to \$3,130. Many of my
clients could not get any credit at all.

### 2013

2013 is the year that Mr. Pence changed job because they had a excess
social security tax refund of \$287, which indicated he had more than one
employer. Cold knowledge: the social security tax has an upper limit,
when one has two or more employers, combined they may withhold social
security tax above the upper limit, and the excess will be refunded.

The new job as governor pays less, the family income was reduced to
\$117K (vs \$164K in prior year). In this year, the youngest daughter
Audrey also went to college, Northeastern University in MA. Due to
their decreased income, they got the full \$7,500 education credit,
maximum possible credit for three students.

They sold the house in VA because they deducted the remaining mortgage
points (\$1,716) which they amortized in previously (\$91). If they
had not sold the house, it would take them 18.86 years (1716/91) to
recover the mortgage points, which represents the remaining life of
the loan. From this we can infer that they took a 30 year loan in 2001
(2013+18-30). Both of the property tax (\$1,928) and mortgage interest
(\$3,273) were low, they must had sold the house in the early part of
the year. This was the last year they had house in the return, they must
had lived in the governor's mansion provided by the state of Indiana.

This year the Mr. Pence starts to contribute to HSA, which meant they
had chosen a high deductible medical insurance plan. They contributed
the maximum amount \$6,450, and had \$1,200 out of pocket medical expense.

### 2014

The family's income continue to fell in 2014 down to \$106K. Mrs. Pence's
business didn't help much with gross income being only \$845, and net
income \$634. To help making the ends meet, they distributed \$40,000
from pension. I assume they started to take student loan, as they claimed
student loan interest deduction of \$952.

Normally one has to pay a 10% penalty for early distribution, but they
applied for an exception "separation from service after age 55" (code
01). I doubt this was the right reason code as Mr. Pence was not separated
from service. The proper code would be 08 ("Higher education purposes").

This year they also got the full education credit \$5,000 for two
students. I am not sure why Audrey was not in the list, either she got a
scholarship, or not a full time student for the year, or the accountant
made an error.

They took a standard deduction this year, since they sold the house and
I believe they did not make donation large enough to itemize.

### 2015

2015 is the last year for which the tax return is available. In this
year, the income was similar to last year, \$109,807. Mrs. Pence started
a business, "That's My Towel Charm Inc", which many people considered
as silly. The business has a loss of \$3,407.

Again they took a distribution of \$9,370. The amount seems odd, it
is likely that was all the money left in the account of Mr. Pence,
considering that Mrs. Pence had only \$1,540 in her ROTH IRA. I do not
understand Why it is considered as normal distribution (code 7) since
Mrs. Pence has not reached 59.5 years old.

This is the year in which Michael J. is no longer a dependent, because
he has reached 24. They got the maximum education credit of \$5,000 for
the two daughters. They were also able to claim the maximum student loan
interest deduction \$2,500.

Despite of the student loan, and the reliance on the retirement savings,
they donated \$8,723 which they deducted from the return. Also deducted
is the personal property tax \$109 on the car, which was modest or even
old that Mrs. Pence used. Many of my clients had luxury cars and paid
a lot of more car tax.

### Postscript

If we use Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) as a dividing line between
upper middle class and middle class, the Pence family is a solid middle
class. They were able to get in part or in whole all the deductions
and credit. Like many middle classes, they have to take mortgage loan
and education loan. They struggled when their children started to go
to college.

The family's economic condition must have dramatically improved since
Mike Pence found a new job as the vice president of United States,
which paid him \$243,500 (2018), almost doubled his salary as governor,
and the government also provides free housing. However,
we do not have a tax return to see this. As Mr. Trump decides not to
release his tax returns, I believe Mr. Pence does not want to embarrass
him by releasing his returns alone.

Many new immigrants do not know their economic position in the US,
you may want compare your family income with that of Pence family. It
is likely yours is higher than the vice president, and higher than the
vice president and president combined if Mr. Trump takes \$1 as salary
as he said he would take.
