## About HSA

We all know that we can choose between to pay tax now or later. Wouldn't it better if we don't pay tax at all, either now or later?
Yes, such a thing exists and it is called Health Savings Account, or HSA.

You are eligible to setup an HSA account when you have High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP). HSA has the following properties:

- (+) Exempt from tax. You can contribute via payroll or yourself. Payroll is better as it skips the FICA taxes as well.
- (+) You can invest just like a broker account.
- (+) No "use it or lose it". The account is yours.
- (+) Tax free for medical expenses. You can pay for prior years' expenses as long as you keep receipts.
- (+) Used for retirement if (age >= 65). Pay normal tax but no penalty, like IRA.
- (-) Contribution limit is $3,500 (single) and $7,100 (family). +$1,000 if (age >= 55).
- (-) FSA becomes limited to dental and vision only.
- (-) California does not honor HSA for state tax. CA does not honor federal treaties with other countries either. CA needs revenue.
- (-) 20% penalty for non-qualified expenses.

The premium for HDHP is low, and it is likely to be covered entirely
by the employer for employee only plan. It is more suitable for
someone who is healthy, and does not expect to have large expenses,
but just in case, which is what insurance is really for.
