## About HSA

We all know that we can choose between to pay tax now (ROTH) or later [401(k)]. Wouldn't it be better if we don't pay tax at all, either now or later?
Yes, such a thing exists and it is called Health Savings Account, or HSA.

You are eligible to setup an HSA account when you have High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP). HSA has the following properties:

- (+) Contribution is tax deductible. You can contribute via payroll or yourself. Payroll is better as it skips the FICA taxes as well.
- (+) You can invest just like a broker account.
- (+) No "use it or lose it". The account is yours.
- (+) Distribution for medical expenses is tax free.
- (+) You can pay for prior years' expenses as long as you keep receipts.
- (+) You can pay for family members regardless the HDHP is single or family.
- (+) Used for retirement if (age >= 65). Pay normal tax but no penalty, like IRA.
- (-) Contribution limit is $3,500 (single HDHP, 2020) and $7,100 (family HDHP, 2020). +$1,000 if (age >= 55) for either single or family.
- (-) Cannot have regular FSA even for spouse not covered by the HDHP because the FSA covers the entire family.
- (-) Cannot have regular FSA with balance after plan expiration after 12/31 (grace period, rollover).
- (-) Can have Limited Purpose FSA (LPFSA): dental and vision any time and medical after deductible met only at employer's discretion. Debit card takes care of this automatically to some extend.
- (-) Married people: if either spouse has a family HDHP, both treated having family HDHP. The combined contribution is $7,100 (2020) split between spouses equally or otherwise.
- (-) 20% penalty for non-qualified expenses.
- (-) California does not honor HSA for state tax purpose.

The premium for HDHP is low, and it is likely to be covered entirely
by the employer for employee only plan. It is more suitable for
someone who is healthy, and does not expect to have large expenses,
but just in case, which is what insurance is really for.
